The package uses a cleaned version of SSB's overview of [historical changes in the municipality structure](https://www.ssb.no/metadata/alle-endringer-i-de-regionale-inndelingene/_/attachment/download/fe7adaa5-aeca-401f-95ff-688465ecf48f:0700aa845b3e92021383b96789be7237f87650ba/kommuneendringer_1838_2017.xlsx) to produce clusters of municipalities that can be followed consistently between two given years. It was developed to meet the needs of the author and his coauthors.

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("eirikberger/NoRwayGeo")
```

The current version of the package only supports Norwegian municipalities, which are built in. 

```{r}
# Load library
library(NoRwayGeo)
```

## Consistent Municipality Structures

Run commands for years between and including 1980 and 2000.

```{r}
print_changes(1980, 2000)
```

```{r}
print_clusters(1980, 2000)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
graph_clusters(1980, 2000)
```

<a href="https://github.com/eirikberger/NoRwayGeo"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eirikberger/NoRwayGeo/main/man/figures/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png"/></a>

```{r}
count_clusters(1980, 2000)
```

## Linking Municipality Names to Number

The data with historical municipality names are built in. Here is an example of how to use it.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
match_municipality("Oppegaard")
```

You can also add optional argument to help the linking algorithm.

```{r}
match_municipality("Oppegaard", year = 1950, county_number = 2, threshold = 0.1)
```

## Logo

The logo for this package uses a self portrait by famous Norwegian painter [Nikolai Astrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Astrup) (1880â€“1928). His name brother, [Nikolai Astrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Astrup_(politician)), was a minister in the Norwegian Government responsible for merging municipalities as a part of a large reform in 2020-2021. He is therefore responsible for increasing the problem of changing municipality structures over time.
